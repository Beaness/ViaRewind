**ViaVersion addon to allow 1.8.x and 1.7.x clients on newer server versions.** <br>
Runs on 1.9-latest servers or 1.8 clients and lower.

**On Fabric, use either [ViaFabric](https://modrinth.com/mod/viafabric) or [ViaFabricPlus](https://modrinth.com/mod/viafabricplus). To override the included version**
- in **ViaFabric**, put ViaRewind into the `mods` folder
- in **ViaFabricPlus**, put ViaRewind into the `ViaFabricPlus/jars` folder

**Depending on the platform and version, this also requires [ViaVersion](https://modrinth.com/mod/viaversion) and [ViaBackwards](https://modrinth.com/mod/viabackwards).**

Support Status
-
While ViaRewind will keep getting updates to function with changes to ViaVersion or ViaBackwards, it will likely not receive many bug fixes or additional features anymore.
